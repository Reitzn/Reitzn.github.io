## Term Project
### Meme-Man
For my term project in CIS-641, my team and I are developing a clone of Pac-Man.  This clone uses internet Memes instead of the traditional Pac-Man images.  We are able to do this by utilizing java and properly building out classes. The purpose of this project is to get hands on experience of what a project would look like in the computer industry.  Our team got experience developing models and diagrams, creating deliverables, and presenting out project to our pers.
