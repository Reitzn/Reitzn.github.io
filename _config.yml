          The goal of this project was to build out a PHP/HTML/CSS website for a Computer Science masters class. My profesor kept the options of what to make pretty open. I decided to make a simple resume style website with some backend session capabilities. We were not allowed to use JavaScript.

            Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.
