          Our project is based off the core premise of Pac-Man. Your character moves around the maze while trying to avoid collisions with walls or ghosts. The playerâ€™s goal is to collect all of the dots, which both increase your score and allow you to beat each level. There are special power-ups that allow you to eat ghosts. Our unique addition to the game comes in the form of Meme-based sprites.

          The goal of this project was to build out a PHP/HTML/CSS website for a Computer Science masters class. My professor kept the options of what to make pretty open. I decided to make a simple resume style website with some backend session capabilities. We were not allowed to use JavaScript.
